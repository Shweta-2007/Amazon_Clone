# Amazon_Clone

The Amazon Clone project is a replica of the Amazon website's user interface. It aims to provide a simplified and static representation of Amazon's web page layout and design, focusing on the visual aspects. This project serves as a front-end practice exercise and does not include dynamic functionality or e-commerce capabilities.

Key Features:

Navigation Bar: The project replicates Amazon's navigation bar, including the Amazon logo, delivery location, search bar, user account information, and the shopping cart.

Dropdown Menu: A dropdown menu provides options like "Today's Deals," "Customer Service," "Registry," "Gift Cards," and "Sell," similar to Amazon's menu options.

Hero Section: The hero section showcases a message to inform users about shopping on Amazon India and provides a link to redirect to Amazon India.

Shop Section: This section replicates various product categories with images, titles, and "Shop Now" links. It imitates Amazon's product promotion layout.

Footer: The project includes a footer with links, legal information, and the Amazon logo. It resembles the layout of Amazon's footer section.
